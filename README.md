# Pymaceuticals Analysis

## Overview

This project, **Pymaceuticals**, is an assignment for the U of MN data science bootcamp that involved completing data tasks within a Jupyter Notebook. Using Python and the Pandas library, I performed data analysis on a dataset showing mice data (weight,tumor size) over time for 8 different drug treatments. To complete this assignment, multiple visuals using pyplot were created, including box plots and a scatter plot with a plotted linear regression analysis.
## Project Structure

- **Notebook**: The Jupyter Notebook in `Pymaceuticals` is the primary script used for analysis, featuring data manipulation and table views to gain insights. This file was provided to me via the bootcamp and contained starter code. 
- **Data Files**: Relevant data files were provided, enabling the analysis and generation of trend observations. Find these in the `Data` folder.
